Gradle is an open-source build-automation system that builds upon the concepts of Apache Ant and Apache Maven and introduces a Groovy-based domain-specific language (DSL) instead of the XML form used by Apache Maven for declaring the project configuration.[2] Gradle uses a directed acyclic graph ("DAG") to determine the order in which tasks can be run.
